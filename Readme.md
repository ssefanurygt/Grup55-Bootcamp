### Product Description
ThinkFirst is an innovative AI learning platform designed to enhance analytical thinking skills in children and young adults. Unlike traditional AI assistants, it employs the Socratic method to encourage users to think critically rather than providing direct answers. The platform asks age-appropriate questions tailored to the user's knowledge level, helping them reach solutions independently. This approach promotes active learning and problem-solving skills instead of passive information consumption.

### Product Features

**Socratic Inquiry Engine:**
Utilizes Gemini API to guide users through thought-provoking questions and hints rather than providing direct answers.

**Age Group Adaptation:**
Provides interaction with appropriate language and complexity levels based on user's age and educational level.

**Interactive Dialog System:**
Creates a dynamic conversation environment offering step-by-step learning experiences.

**Learning Progress Tracking:**
Tracks and reports user's thinking skill development using Firebase Firestore.

**Multi-Subject Support:**
Offers assistance across various subjects including mathematics, science, social studies, and language learning.

**Parent Control Panel:**
Secure panel with Firebase Authentication for parents to monitor their children's learning progress.

**Gamification Elements:**
Achievement badges, progress bars, and reward systems synchronized with Firebase Realtime Database.

**Safe Content Filtering:**
Automatic filtering of age-inappropriate content.

### Target Audience
ThinkFirst's target audience consists of students aged 8-18 and their parents. Specifically:
- Families wanting to develop their children's analytical thinking skills
- Students who prefer understanding over memorization while doing homework
- Teachers who support technology use in education
- Parents who want their children to use screen time productively
